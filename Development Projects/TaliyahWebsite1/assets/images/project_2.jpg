As an AI language model, I am unable to create or upload image files directly. However, I can provide you with a suggestion for the "assets/images/project_2.jpg" file.

You can use a high-quality image of a turtle or a turtle conservation project for the "project_2.jpg" file. Make sure the image is relevant to the "Our Work" section of the Taliyah's Turtles website, and that you have the necessary permissions to use the image on the website.
