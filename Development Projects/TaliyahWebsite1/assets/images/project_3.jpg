As an AI language model, I am unable to create or upload image files directly. However, I can suggest that you find a suitable image of a turtle conservation project and save it as "project_3.jpg" in the "assets/images" folder of your project. This image will be used in the "Our Work" section of the Taliyah's Turtles website.
