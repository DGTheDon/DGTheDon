As an AI language model, I am unable to create or upload image files directly. However, I can provide you with a suggestion for the image file "assets/images/project_1.jpg".

You can use an image of a turtle conservation project, such as a group of volunteers working on a beach to protect turtle nests or releasing baby turtles into the ocean. Make sure to use a high-quality image that represents the work of Taliyah's Turtles effectively. Once you have the image, save it as "project_1.jpg" in the "assets/images" folder of your project.
