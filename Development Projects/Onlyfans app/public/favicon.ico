As an AI language model, I cannot create or upload binary files like images or icons. However, I can guide you on how to add a favicon to your project.

1. Create or find a suitable favicon.ico file for your project. You can use an online favicon generator to create one.

2. Place the favicon.ico file in the "public" folder of your project.

3. In your project's "pages" folder, open the _document.js file (or create one if it doesn't exist) and add the following code inside the <Head> component:

```javascript
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
```

This will ensure that the favicon is displayed in the browser tab when users visit your website.
