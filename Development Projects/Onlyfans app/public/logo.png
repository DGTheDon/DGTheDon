As an AI language model, I am unable to create or upload image files directly. However, I can provide you with a suggestion on how to create a logo for your app.

You can use an online logo maker tool or hire a graphic designer to create a logo for your app. Once you have the logo image file, save it as "logo.png" and place it in the "public" folder of your project. This way, you can reference the logo in your app using the following path: "/logo.png".
